# Adrian's Coding Portfolio

This is a collection of all my programs from 2018 to present.

## Text-Based Adventure Game - Java

The first major Java program that I made in 2018, is a simple text-based adventure game where the aim is to defeat the dragon. You collect items and uses them to progress toward your goal. It uses If, Switch, for loop, arrays, Scanner, and println.

## Online Artwork Gallery - HTML, CSS, BootStrap, PHP, mySQL

This is a Website code for a simple Online Artwork Gallery that I made in 2018. it has a feature of creating a user account and login in and submit your artwork to be displayed on the website. This is a apache webserver to run but the code all works.

The Design and formatting are done using HTML and ccs with header.inc , footer.inc, and nav.inc. all the function like add user, login out and displaying pictures is done using PHP. and all the pictures and user details are accessed and saved with a MySQL database.

## BikeShopCLI - Java

This is a bike shop program made in 2019, that allows the user to rent bikes, add customers, add bikes and print rent to a file. this program uses the Command Line Interface to run. It uses methods, File Input and Output Stream and Exception

## BikeShopGUI- Java

Same as 'BikeShopCLI - Java' but using AWT and Swing to create a GUI for the program

## CoinGameCLI - Java

This was made in 2019 and is a coin gambling game where the player spins a coin and is compared with the host coin and depending on the outcome points are rewarded, it is made with the Eclipse IDE and using command line to output the results. it uses features like interfaces and random methods.

## DiceGameCLI - Java

created in 2020, this is a dice game with similar requirement to CoinGameCLI but instead of a coin we roll 2 dice and compare it with the host dices roll and depending on the outcome points are rewarded. It is created with Eclipse IDE and is played using the command line. This is the last java project i used Eclipse IDE to create before switching to intellj IDEA.

## DiceGameGUI - Java

## Azul - C++

This was the biggest program that I ever created and the first time I am using c++, this is a CLI of a board game called Azul and I did it with 2 other members. this is also the first time I have used a git to work on a program so I had to learn how to commit, push, pull, merge, and the best way to work with others in a git. this version given is our based program with also individual enhancement made by myself, which includes making the game work with up to 4 players with 2 central board, this program is the best to showcase my ability as a programmer and a software designer.

## AGME Booking System - Springboot, junit5, javascript, css, html, typescript, scss, bulma, docker, circleci, aws, emzyme, react, node.js, kubernetes, maven, etc

This was the most craziest and intensive project i ever worked on, created in 2020 during COVID19 lockdown, 4 other guys and myself were tasked with creating a multi business booking website with different user account times, stateless design, API and using node.js and react. this is the first time that i followed and used the Agile scrum methodology in the creation of this project with a lot of new programming language to learn in my own time. this is also the first project with a dedicated front-end and back-end part which we all worked on. front and back end testing was a new and exciting concept to learn and create in order to test our programs functionality. lastly deployment was something that all of us had to learn to do ver quickly has the timeline for this project was 6 months. this was a hard and fun project that i have worked on and has taught me a lot the processes of being a software developer.

## Enjoy :)
